You are given a sequence of {%text_count%} texts describing a video arranged in time order.
Your task is to group consecutive texts with similar contents into text groups, and summarize all texts in each group into a long passage.
Separate the texts into another group whenever a significant enough change happens.
The change could be anything such as venue change, a person walking out of frame, etc.
All {%text_count%} texts must be included in exactly 1 group.

You MUST output the result in JSON format according to the following JSON schema:
{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "start": {
                "type": "integer", 
                "description": "Id of the first text in the group"
            },
            "end": {
                "type": "integer", 
                "description": "Id of the last text in the group"
            },
            "summary": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "A summary of every text included in the group."
            }
        },
        "required": ["start", "end", "summary"]
    }
}

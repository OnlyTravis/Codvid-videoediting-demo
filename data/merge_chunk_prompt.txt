You are given a sequence of texts describing a video arranged in time order.
Your task is to cut the sequence of text whenever a significant enough change happens, and summarize texts from each segment into a long passage.
The change could be anything such as venue change, a person walking out of frame, etc.

You MUST output the result in JSON format according to the following JSON schema:
{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "start": {
                "type": "integer", 
                "description": "Start id of the first text in the merged output"
            },
            "end": {
                "type": "integer", 
                "description": "End id of the last text in the merged output"
            },
            "description": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Detailed description what's happening in the frame sequence."
            }
        },
        "required": ["start", "end", "description"]
    }
}
The unprocessed footage is about: "{%video_description%}"

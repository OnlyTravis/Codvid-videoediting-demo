Your task is to describe each and every image provided which contains a series of {%frame_count%} frames concatenated from left to right extracted from a raw footage.
You are provided with two things:
- A description of the raw video
- multiple images each containing a series of {%frame_count%} frames concatenated from left to right
Make sure the descriptions are informative enough to reproduce the video.
Your description must include if applicable:
situation, venue, objects, people, changes, colors, emotions, etc..
You MUST output the result in JSON format according to the following JSON schema:
{
    "type": "array",
    "items": {
        "type": "object",
        "properties": {
            "name": {
                "type": "string", 
                "description": "Name of the frame sequence, formatted as 'frame_sequence_<index>'"
            },
            "description": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Detailed description what's happening in the frame sequence."
            }
        },
        "required": ["name", "description"]
    }
}
The unprocessed footage is about: "{%video_description%}"
